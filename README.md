# PA1473 - Software Development: Agile Project

## Introduction

In this poject we programed a robot to be able to do different tasks based on requirements given by our "stakeholders". The project was divided into three sprints (2 weeks each).

## Getting started

(1) install GIT
(2) install python 
(3) install LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Brick and BrickPi3
(4) clone Github project
(5) connect to robot

## Building and running

To operate our program you have to upload the code to the LEGO robot. Before uploading the code to the robot you need to choose the part of the program you want to run, all you need to do is call for the desired function where the SortItems function is called (eg replace the call for SortItems at the bottom of the code), and the program will ask for needed inputs when the code runs. If you write an incorrect input the program will ask you for a new input. 

## Features

Features
- [x] US01: As a customer, I want the robot to pick up item (SP 13)
- [x] US02: As a customer, I want the robot to drop off item (SP 8)
- [x] US04: As a customer, I want the robot to tell me the color of an item (SP 20)
- [x] US03: As a customer, I want the robot to be able to determine if an item is present at a given location (SP 8)
- [x] US04B: As a customer, I want the robot to tell me the color of an item at a designated position (SP 8)
- [x] US08B As a customer, I want to be able to calibrate items with three different colors and drop the items off at specific drop-off zones based on color (SP 100)
- [x] US06: As a customer, I want the robot to be able to pick up items from elevated positions (SP 40)
- [x] US10: As a customer, I want the robots to sort items at a specific time (SP 20)
- [x] US02B: As a customer, I want the robot to drop items off at a designated position. (SP 8)
- [x] US01B: As a customer, I want the robot to pick up items from a designated position (SP 8)
- [x] US05: As a customer, I want the robot to drop items off at different locations based on the color of the item (SP 40)
- [x] US09: As a customer, I want the robot to check the pickup location periodically to see if a new item has arrived (SP 5)

Did not develop
- [ ] US11: As a customer, I want two robots to communicate and work together on items sorting without colliding with each other. (SP 100)
- [ ] US12: As a customer, I want to be able to manually set the locations and heights of one pick-up zone and two drop-off zones. (Implemented either by manually dragging the arm to a position or using buttons) (SP 40)
